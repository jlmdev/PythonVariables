# PythonVariables

This is a simple program for working with Python in conjunction with an SDG research project.
I'm going through some of the early homework projects that were originally done in C# and recreating them in Python.

## Original assignment

### Explorer Mode

Create a new app that does the following.

### Practice Creating Variables

- Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) that stores the numberOfCupsOfCoffee that you drink every day.
- Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) called fullName and set it equal to your full name.
- Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) called today and set it equal to today's date.
- Use Console.WriteLine and your variables, numberOfCupsOfCoffee, fullName, and today, to output all three on one line.
- Practice Getting Input From the User

- Ask the user for their name and store it in a variable named userName.
- Print out a greeting to the user, using their name.
- Practice Getting Different Types of Input From the User

- Ask the user to input two numbers.
- Get the numbers as strings using Console.ReadLine, store them in variables named firstNumberAsString and secondNumberAsString
- Converting String Input Into Numbers

- Convert each string above to a double using double.Parse. Save the first value in a variable named firstOperand and the second value in a variable named secondOperand.
- Doing Math

- Add the operand variables from above and save the results in a variable named sum.
- Subtract the secondOperand variable from the firstOperand variable and save the results in a variable named difference.
- Multiply the operand variables and save the results in a variable named product.
- Divide the firstOperand by the secondOperand and save the results in a variable named quotient.
- Find the remainder when one operand is divided by the other and save the results in a variable named remainder. See this page if you need to learn more about the modulo operator.
- Use Console.WriteLine to present the user, in a meaningful way, each of the values for the sum, difference, quotient, product, and remainder variables. (e.g. perhaps one of your outputs is similar to If you add 4 and 5 you get 9 if 4 and 5 were the input)
